The profiles here have been updated, but I am keeping them in case there are some compatibility issues with the older software.

### MK3 Pretty PETG Profile
Profile by Chris Warkocki

Even though I'm swamped with work I've had to reprint some parts lately and put together a nice PETG profile for parts that doubles as a nice pretty PETG profile.

Feel free to adjust the infill as I'm having a kick using gyroid but all in all this is just a nice simple PETG profile that should give you good results fo general prints and parts for upgrades.

Created in and for Slic3r 1.40.0 Beta for the MK3 but this will work just fine on a MK2.5 and MK2s.

### MK3 Pretty PLA Profile
Profile by Chris Warkocki

The best things comes in threes. So we have a nice new PETG profile for slic3r, a speed PLA profile, but it's time to take everything I learned from my last profile that I did wrong and redo it and finalize it a bit.

I got some great feedback and went back to the drawing board and viola we have a preset made for pretty prints using PLA. This will work on the MK3 only.

I've zoned the speeds as best as possible to reduce motor resonance as well as other printing artifacts.

Enjoy and don't forget to keep on printing.


Best with Slic3r 1.40.0 beta and above.

### Chris MK3 PLA V3
Profile by Chris Warkocki

I'm way slower than normal but it's time for an official update to the Slic3r 1.40 alpha 1 profile from me. This is very specific and targeted directly at those with issues of uneven extrusion on the MK3. After 3 weeks and lots of brainstorming I've taken a lot of input from smart people and tweaked the living poop out of it. I'm happy to say that initial prints on various MK3's show improvement to the extrusion issue.


### MK3 Pretty PETG V2
Profile by Chris Warkocki

I couldn't just post post a PLA profile so here is the update PETG profile. This one is a little faster than the last one but still gives really nice results. Again, no ooze while mesh leveling and the special purge bubble in the beginning to prime the nozzle just right for PETG. Happy printing!

### MK3 Pretty PLA V2
Profile by Chris Warkocki

The latest and greatest release of Slic3r PE has finally hit. I've been waiting for a couple bug fixes before launching an all new profile and it just dropped an hour ago. Welcome to Slic3r PE 1.41.0 BETA. 

A few refinements and adjustments based on the all new jerk and acceleration menu as well as refinements to the start and end gcode. Goodbye blobs on the bed. Have fun and happy printing.

# Slic3r profiles for Prusa i3 MK3

### MK3 Pretty PETG Profile
Profile by Chris Warkocki

Even though I'm swamped with work I've had to reprint some parts lately and put together a nice PETG profile for parts that doubles as a nice pretty PETG profile.

Feel free to adjust the infill as I'm having a kick using gyroid but all in all this is just a nice simple PETG profile that should give you good results fo general prints and parts for upgrades.

Created in and for Slic3r 1.40.0 Beta for the MK3 but this will work just fine on a MK2.5 and MK2s.
### MK3 Pretty PLA Profile
Profile by Chris Warkocki

The best things comes in threes. So we have a nice new PETG profile for slic3r, a speed PLA profile, but it's time to take everything I learned from my last profile that I did wrong and redo it and finalize it a bit.

I got some great feedback and went back to the drawing board and viola we have a preset made for pretty prints using PLA. This will work on the MK3 only.

I've zoned the speeds as best as possible to reduce motor resonance as well as other printing artifacts.

Enjoy and don't forget to keep on printing.

### MK3 Speed PLA Profile
Profile by Chris Warkocki

Some people want to print fast but still have a decent print. I've played with this over the course of the last three weeks and a few dozen random or so prints and I think it's ready.

These speeds are more in the MK3 realm so I wouldn't use this for the MK2s or MK2.5 but if someone wants to test them please let me know if they work on them.

Best with Slic3r 1.40.0 beta and above.

### Chris MK3 PLA V3

I'm way slower than normal but it's time for an official update to the Slic3r 1.40 alpha 1 profile from me. This is very specific and targeted directly at those with issues of uneven extrusion on the MK3. After 3 weeks and lots of brainstorming I've taken a lot of input from smart people and tweaked the living poop out of it. I'm happy to say that initial prints on various MK3's show improvement to the extrusion issue.

### pp_tpu_config

slic3r PE for my mk3. Been working great, use at your own risk.

I would do the e-correct tower in PLA and change the e-correct (if needed) first.

And always use glue or something (baby powder, windex, etc) with TPU. I use glue.

For me each filament even from the same brand requires a specific temperature. Some need extrusion multiplier of 0.9 or 0.95. I use sainsmart.

### MK3 3Dxtech Matte Petg
Profile by Chris Warkocki

#3dxtech just sent some sample Pretty Ridiculous Ultra Super Awesome Orange matte petg my way for testing. P.R.U.S.A. Orange is a near perfect match to the old ABS parts and prints like a dream as usual with every petg they sell.

I've been messing with settings and have it locked down by increasing the print temps and doing some flexing here and there

# Slic3r profiles for Prusa i3 MK3

### MK3 Pretty PETG Profile
Profile by Chris Warkocki

Even though I'm swamped with work I've had to reprint some parts lately and put together a nice PETG profile for parts that doubles as a nice pretty PETG profile.

Feel free to adjust the infill as I'm having a kick using gyroid but all in all this is just a nice simple PETG profile that should give you good results fo general prints and parts for upgrades.

Created in and for Slic3r 1.40.0 Beta for the MK3 but this will work just fine on a MK2.5 and MK2s.
### MK3 Pretty PLA Profile

The best things comes in threes. So we have a nice new PETG profile for slic3r, a speed PLA profile, but it's time to take everything I learned from my last profile that I did wrong and redo it and finalize it a bit.

I got some great feedback and went back to the drawing board and viola we have a preset made for pretty prints using PLA. This will work on the MK3 only.

I've zoned the speeds as best as possible to reduce motor resonance as well as other printing artifacts.

Enjoy and don't forget to keep on printing.

### MK3 Speed PLA Profile

Some people want to print fast but still have a decent print. I've played with this over the course of the last three weeks and a few dozen random or so prints and I think it's ready.

These speeds are more in the MK3 realm so I wouldn't use this for the MK2s or MK2.5 but if someone wants to test them please let me know if they work on them.

Best with Slic3r 1.40.0 beta and above.

I'm way slower than normal but it's time for an official update to the Slic3r 1.40 alpha 1 profile from me. This is very specific and targeted directly at those with issues of uneven extrusion on the MK3. After 3 weeks and lots of brainstorming I've taken a lot of input from smart people and tweaked the living poop out of it. I'm happy to say that initial prints on various MK3's show improvement to the extrusion issue.

# Slic3r profiles for Prusa i3 MK3

### MK3 Pretty PETG Profile
Profile by Chris Warkocki

The best things comes in threes. So we have a nice new PETG profile for slic3r, a speed PLA profile, but it's time to take everything I learned from my last profile that I did wrong and redo it and finalize it a bit.

I got some great feedback and went back to the drawing board and viola we have a preset made for pretty prints using PLA. This will work on the MK3 only.

I've zoned the speeds as best as possible to reduce motor resonance as well as other printing artifacts.

Enjoy and don't forget to keep on printing.

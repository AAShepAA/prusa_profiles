More Pretty goodness. A super amazing person on twitter that goes by the handle @DasMia shared her MK3 Cura profile. I sat in the lab for a few hours and tweaked in the goodness that you know so well.

Prints well but I don't have too many hours into it. Cubes and such look awesome so please print some tests if you have time and let me know how it's going with images of the prints.

I've also included the setup guide for the start and end gcode.

If you're new to Cura here is how to set this up.

1. Install the latest version
2. Go to preferences > printers and then hit the ADD button
3. Add the MK2 since it's close enough but adjust the bed Z height to 210mm
4. Copy and paste the Start Gcode from the text file [here](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Ffile%2Fd%2F1CZoCf_uTdyhheUZogAhVBJJM4MULbM6R%2Fview%3Fusp%3Dsharing&h=AT3HmGnfT7Z_VfUNqdYhFfGADtq8IIx2HiUytW2r2Y6TphkWTrqiGGZbkpwTcZBF_3YSTT7-yqjx11GFsK4WMAyTyPp6hZc3M53go38EjYUOc2giMhsdB3mxNVon_sLxZzNuNfPn2rhgTDLltBPg1r7QES7nwCOlVxC415PuoPkxc54wALaFa_VeWmEufhTpMhTbma-gGol2Ri4TeX4e-HPZPoLQEjnpSTZBvC39CxhQT0uDOAzerg4obYSAYk-zAfrttZLipaFrXYPcm3pnsHfCfiQfL_EcEgYRp71xaRYsRMPueRdicf4ywzROe26gapYK-cNrJe75AYqi2msu5Y9o1CbWFuht-tUL0gn8GGI). 

Have fun testing!

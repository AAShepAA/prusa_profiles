# Slic3r profiles for Prusa i3 MK2/2.5

### MK3 Pretty PETG Profile
Profile by Chris Warkocki

Even though I'm swamped with work I've had to reprint some parts lately and put together a nice PETG profile for parts that doubles as a nice pretty PETG profile.

Feel free to adjust the infill as I'm having a kick using gyroid but all in all this is just a nice simple PETG profile that should give you good results fo general prints and parts for upgrades.

Created in and for Slic3r 1.40.0 Beta for the MK3 but this will work just fine on a MK2.5 and MK2s.
### MK2s Pretty PLA Profile

This is the PLA profile for all you MK2s and MK2,5 needs. I realized I set some very specific gcode parameters that only work with the MK3 profile.

Print away and print often!

Slic3r 1.40.0 Beta profile and above.
